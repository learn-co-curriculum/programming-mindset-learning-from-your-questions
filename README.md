# Learning from Your Questions

- Identify effective methods of formulating questions

## Introduction

Before we get the right answer, we need to know how to ask the right question.
Figuring out how to ask the right question is a process of clarifying exactly
what we want the result to be as well as taking stock of all the information we
currently have. The more thought we put into asking questions, the better chance
we give ourselves of getting the right answer—either from others, or by
ourselves.

## Identify Effective Methods of Formulating Questions

Sometimes, it's clear to us what we don't know and what we need to ask for. But
often it's not so clear. Often, we don't know what we don't know and that makes
it difficult to formulate a question to ask about it. In these not-so-clear
cases, we can start with a process of determining what we _do_ know. Eventually,
this process will lead us to the right question.

Here's some steps to take when you're questions:

1. __Focus on small section of code.__ Don’t keep scanning several files for a
bug. Reducing the amount of material to sort through will allow you or potential
helpers to isolate the issues faster and easier.

2. __State your inputs.__ Double-check what data is getting pulled into your
program. Is your code reading the correct file? Were the values entered
correctly? If an input is wrong, it could throw off all of your code.

3. __State your outputs.__ Similarly, double-check what data is getting pushed
out of your program. If you're not getting out what you want, you might be able
to trace it backwards to the source of the problem.

4. __State your expectation.__ In order to determine whether your outputs are
right or wrong, you need to compare what you're getting to what you expected to
get.

5. __State your theory for what should have happened.__ You might have an idea
what you wanted to get as an result, but how did you get that idea? Double-check
your understanding of how the code is working. Did you miss anything that would
explain a different result?

6. __Check the docs to make sure your implementation works like you think it
did.__ As you're exploring your theory, take a look at any relevant reference
documentation. Sometimes we can get incorrect ideas of how something should work
stuck in our heads.

7. __Test the implementation in IRB.__ There's no substitute for running bits of
your code in a safe environment to make sure it functions how you intend it to
function. IRB is here to help. You can always test out code there while not
disturbing the rest of what you've written.

8. ___If necessary at this point_, submit the question.__ Still have questions?
Now you should at least have a clearer idea of what specifically you need to ask
for. So _now_ you can ask.

Here's the secret about asking questions: when you follow a series of steps like
these, you're running through all of the questions someone else might ask _you_
when they're trying to gather enough information to solve your problem, and,
often, this is enough to uncover the solution on your own. But even if it's not,
you've done all the necessary prework for narrowing down what you need to ask
someone else for help with, which means they will be able to help you more
effectively, and get you back to coding faster.

## Conclusion

If we follow a set of effective methods for formulating questions, we are
generally able to either come up with the answers on our own or present a
question that is targeted, informed and most likely to produce the result we
need.
